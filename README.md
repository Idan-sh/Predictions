# Predictions
A Java based project that runs simulations that evaluate the outcome of changes to an environment.

The simulations will define a population of entities that exists within a world, on which a set of "rules" are set to change
statistically in one way or another some of the entities' properties.

The system is generic, and is a foundation for various types of simulations on diverse environments.

# Predictions
A Java-based application designed for conducting simulations to assess the impact of modifications to an environment.  

The simulations involve defining a population of entities within a virtual world, where a set of rules is applied to statistically modify certain properties of the entities.

The system is characterized by its generality, serving as a robust foundation for diverse simulations across different environments. It offers a versatile platform capable of accommodating various types of simulations to model and analyze changes in complex systems."

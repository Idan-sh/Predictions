## About
A JavaFX application designed for conducting simulations to assess the impact of modifications to an environment.  

The simulations involve defining a population of entities within a virtual world, where a set of rules is applied to statistically modify certain properties of the entities.

The system is characterized by its generality, serving as a robust foundation for diverse simulations across different environments. It offers a versatile platform capable of accommodating various types of simulations to model and analyze changes in complex systems."

## System details:

1. Users can upload an XML file that defines the configuration of the world where the simulation will take place.

</p>

<br />   

2. The user can specify the initial number of entities for each type.

<br />   

3. By utilizing multithreading, simulations can run concurrently. Users can control the number of active threads, effectively creating a queue to manage pending simulations.
